Landing Page
============

This is a very simple Sinatra application as [described by](http://newtoruby.com/all-in-a-days-work-heroku-sinatra-passenger-h) [Joel Gascoigne](http://github.com/joelg) for creating a landing page hosted using [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) and [MongoHQ](http://mongohq.com) free plans. Read Joel's post for a detailed description. I've made a couple tweaks, including setting Haml to HTML 5 and using the placeholder attribute on the input field with the jQuery placeholder plugin as a fallback.
